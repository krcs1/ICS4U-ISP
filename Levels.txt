2 Sawyer: Basically, Self Neglect is the inability

2 themselves. This can include failure to take care
2 of personal hygiene or meet nutritional needs.
2 
0 Kinda sounds like you are implying something 
0 here... Do you think I have self-neglect?
0 
2 Sawyer: You said it not me. But do not be
2 too worried, there are many types of self-neglect.
2 Many young people have basic self-neglect when
2 they are not taking care of themselves.
2 This can include "cough cough" staying hungry.

2 Sawyer: For people like you, you seem to have 
2 milder forms of self-neglect. These include 
2 not taking enough care about your health and
2 hygiene, as well as not sleeping enough.
2 People who suffer from self-neglect often resort 
2 to substance abuse a w way to get by, because 
2 they do not care about their health.
0 
0 Wow so I guess I should be taking more care about 
0 myself.

2 Sawyer: Yeah, if you need help do not resort to  
2 temporary coping tactics like drugs and alcohol.
